# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
The analysis was done through python by logistic regression training method. The DataCleansing.py file is to manage data. The CrossSectionAnalysis.py file and the correlation.py file are used for analyzing variables and selecting features. The cross-section analysis graph and the correlation figure are the procedural output from these two files. The training model was built in the model.py file and the test.py file is used to predict.
The all.py file is simply connecting all the python file together. The output can be obtained by running only the all.py file.
The result of the prediction is written in the prediction.csv file.
